# Vehicle Sales Performance Analysis

![](Store-Cart.jpg)

## Introduction
This project involved using SQL and PowerBI to analyze data from the **Vehicle Sales** dataset and conduct a Sales Performance Analysis.

The dataset used for this project, referred to as **Vehicle Sales**, contains sales data for various types of vehicles across multiple countries. It includes information about sales of different types of vehicles, such as classic cars, motorcycles, planes, ships, and trains & buses, in various markets across North America, Europe, and Asia.

In this Sales Performance Analysis Report, I provided insights like:
- The current market demand for our products and how it varies by region or continent. For instance, the USA leads in both sales and orders, followed by Spain and France.
- The current sales performance and how it compares to past performance and industry benchmarks. The line graph shows a fluctuating trend from January to December.
- The most loyal customers in terms of total sales and orders made. Classic Cars were the most popular product line, leading in the number of orders shipped and sales exceeding the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).

## Project Steps
- Imported the dataset into SQL and created a new schema
- Read through requirements and prepared user story
- Identified required columns from the dataset
- Cleaned the dataset and created views of my queries
- Connected to views in Power Query
- Transformed data in Power Query
- Modeled the data
- Created measures
- Visualized the data
- Published to Power BI Service

The database used for this project is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their data analysis skills. Working through the entire project phase, from data cleaning to visualization, can provide a comprehensive learning experience. If you’re interested in working on a similar project, you can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data).

You can also interact with the interactive dashboard I designed at the end of this project [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjQ0YmQzNGItYzUyZi00ODNmLWJiMjYtZmM5NjA0ZjA4NDA3IiwidCI6IjUxN2QzNTAyLTI5MDEtNGRlMi1hODdiLTk1YzUwN2E5YTA4OCJ9).

## Features
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the sales performance, including key metrics like Total Sales, Average Sales, Average Price for Each Sale, and Average Quantity Ordered. It also displays the top sale and order countries, sales trend over time, and product line distribution.

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive analysis of the Auto Sales dataset yielded valuable insights into the company's sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior. We identified key factors that influence profitability, such as product line preferences and regional variations. High sales correlate with high quantities ordered across product lines, and sales peak in the fourth quarter each year, indicating a seasonal trend. By addressing these factors, implementing strategic changes, and focusing on top-selling product lines and countries, and considering emerging markets, Auto Sales can enhance profitability and strengthen its global market position.

**Recommendations**: 
Based on the analysis, it's crucial to focus on the product lines and regions that generate the most sales. For instance, investing more in Classic Cars could be beneficial as they are the most popular product line. Expanding the market in the USA, Spain, and France could also be advantageous as these countries have the highest sales and orders. Additionally, analyzing the sales trends over time to identify any seasonal patterns or fluctuations could be leveraged for future sales strategies. However, it’s also important to consider other markets that have potential for growth. Countries like Finland, Australia, Germany, and Singapore might currently have lower sales, but with the right strategies, they could represent significant growth opportunities.
